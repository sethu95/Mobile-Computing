GesturePrac_Sethu_Source_Code.zip contains the Project Folder. Extract and put in Android Studio Projects. 
gesture_prac_sethu_manickam.apk is the apk file used for transferring files to ftp://192.168.0.44 server (my local FTP server)

In ThirdActivity java file, please look for URL which is 192.168.0.44, username - sethu, password - xyz123 (these were set up while enabling FTP server)

Server used is Windows default FTP server which I enabled by going into Control Panel. I also set up a username and password for the same. This can be easily 
enabled by going into Administrative Tools in Control Panel, and then Internet Information Services Manager and then allocating a folder in PC to be hosted on
the FTP server. For convenience, turn Windows Firewall to off temporarily. Change URL, username and password as per personal preference. 

I have used URL and URLConnection to generate the BufferedOutputStream. The filenames are generated by using a static HashMap, and updating the practice number in each 
session. I opted not to search the files already present as that involves a bit more computation time and we are transferring videos of size ~8MB, the toaster message
was getting delayed. In order to minimize this delay and to improve user experience, I opted for a static counter based numbering system. All of this you will find 
in the ThirdActivity java file. The design has also been made simplistic to provide a good user experience to ensure that the video is uploaded successfully each time 
an upload attempt is made. 

Please let me know if you have any doubts or clarifications with my code. I can also show a live demo with my PC hosting the local server.

Videos that I have practiced and uploaded can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E7pZ5wKpO0qGKWH6GNkYvMhfSZ9yKPzy
